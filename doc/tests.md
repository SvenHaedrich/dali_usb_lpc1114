## Tests

This script:
```bash
./run_tests.sh

```
prepares a vritual environment, and then runs the tests. Optionally you can
add `--log-level=debug` for more detailled logging.

The test set-up expects a DALI-USB device connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0`, electrically connected with its inputs to a DALI power supply.
